            <h5 class="text-primary">1. Introduction</h5>
            <p>
              This document outlines the commission and service fees associated
              with transactions on the Anturaz platform.
            </p>

            <h5 class="text-primary">2. Platform Commission</h5>
            <p>
              Anturaz charges a commission fee of 7% on the total sale price of
              each item sold by stores on our platform. This fee is deducted
              from the store's payout.
            </p>

            <h5 class="text-primary">3. Service Fees</h5>
            <p>
              There are no service fees for both shoppers and store owners when
              using our platform. However, store owners may subscribe to our
              other services such as ads and boosting, additional storage or
              item, and additional users for certain fees. You may find these
              services and their prices in the store owner’s dashboard.
            </p>

            <h5 class="text-primary">4. Taxes</h5>
            <p>
              Store owners are responsible for fulfilling their tax obligations
              with the government. Anturaz may withhold tax from the store’s
              payout if required by government regulations.
            </p>

            <h5 class="text-primary">5. Changes to Fees</h5>
            <p>
              Anturaz reserves the right to modify the commission and service
              fees at any time. Any changes will be communicated to users in
              advance and will apply to future transactions.
            </p>
